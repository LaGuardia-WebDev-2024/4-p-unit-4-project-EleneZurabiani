  <h3>Omashu</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Omashu is located in the Kolau Mountain Range in the southwestern Earth Kingdom, built on a mountain that rises high out of a deep gorge. <br>
   The Palace sits on the tallest hill, which is in the center behind some of the other hills. <br>
  The views are breathtaking and so worth visiting.</p>
